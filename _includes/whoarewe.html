	<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
	<p>
	  We're a group of Princeton students who love to build things together.
          While we're mostly engineering and science majors, we
	  welcome anyone with a love for making!
        </p>
        <p>
          We hack at the eLab, where have a MakerBot,
	  soldering irons, more fancy tools, and even more.
        </p>
